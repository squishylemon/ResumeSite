	<h1>My Projects</h1>

	<h2>Game Server Development</h2>
	<p>Game server development work is a part of my experience that involves working with GMod servers using my knowledge of Lua and performing various repetitive tasks. Most of the server development work that I have done was for other people, which can be verified in the references section on my website, where you can find testimonials from previous server owners that I worked with.</p>
	<p>In the past, I have created four servers for BuffaloServers, and over eight servers for DuckRP. I also created multiple servers for LemonRP, which is a server community that I owned. Additionally, I have done some small-time work for various servers that are now defunct and that I have forgotten the names of.</p>
	<p>One of the notable servers that I have worked on is BuffaloServers, which has a website that I helped develop. You can visit the website at www.buffaloservers.com to see some of my work.</p>

	<h2>Hardware Projects</h2>
	<p>I have experience in various real-life hardware projects, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Repaired 3 Xbox 360 consoles, two of which had the red ring of death issue, and one devkit that had no signs of life. I was able to fix all but one of the red ring issues.</li>
		<li>Fixed a PS2 console that had issues with reading discs.</li>
		<li>Built two PCs, using both modern and early 2000s hardware.</li>

	<h2>Game Development</h2>
	<p>Here are some of the game development projects that I have worked on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>Grade 6 (2019) Unity Game - Ball Control</h3>
			<p>In this passion project, I developed a simple game in Unity where the player controls a ball and can spawn a set number of AI-controlled balls to chase them. The game is set on a map with a hole in the middle, and the player must get all the AI balls to fall into the hole to earn points. The game never ends, and the player's highest score is tracked until they exit the game.</p>

			<h3>Grade 8 (2021) Unity Game - Wuhu Island Remastered</h3>
			<p>For this home project, I set out to remaster the Wuhu Island map from Wii Sports Resort in Unity using the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) and testing out new features such as terrain building and creating realistic water. The project is still ongoing, but you can see some of the progress on my website.</p>

            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p>As a self-taught web developer, I have experience in creating and maintaining websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are some of the web development projects that I have worked on:</p>

                    <h3>Personal Website</h3>

                    <h3>Community Website</h3>
                    <p>I created a community website for a GMod server that I owned using WordPress, which features a forum, a donation system, and a store. The website was integrated with various server plugins to provide a seamless experience for users.</p>
