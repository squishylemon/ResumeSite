        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Alex and I have a passion for technology. I am currently enrolled in Business and Information Technology as electives in high school. As of writing this, I have not received any grades for either subject yet, but I am looking forward to my T1 Performance review.</p>
      
        <h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>
        <p>Aside from attending the IT club after school, where I gained basic knowledge of Photoshop, I have not participated in any other extracurricular activities.</p>
      
        <h2>Academic Performance</h2>
        <p>Although my English and math grades are not strong, I have excelled in Information Technology and have consistently received A grades in this subject. My performance in other subjects has been average.</p>
      
        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>In the future, I plan to pursue a career in the technology industry, with a particular interest in game development and software engineering. I am currently working on developing my skills in programming, 3D modeling, and game design. I am also planning to attend a college or university to further my education in computer science.</p>
      
        <h2>References</h2>
        <p>I am a student at Ferny Grove State High School, where I have been able to develop my skills in Information Technology and other subjects. I can provide references from teachers and mentors who can speak to my work ethic, creativity, and passion for technology.</p>
