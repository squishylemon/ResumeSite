      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Alexander Podesta, and I was born on April 19, 2007. I am a
        self-motivated and passionate individual with a keen interest in
        technology, specifically in the fields of game development and IT
        hardware. Even though I'm only 15 years old, I have gained a lot of
        experience in programming, 3D modeling, and IT hardware repairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        My skills in programming are vast and include advanced usage of C#,
        LUA, SQL, JavaScript, and some Python, with an understanding of HTML. I
        have experience in game development and have worked on several
        projects, including remastering the Wuhu Island map from Wii Sports
        Resorts and developing a passion project in Unity for a simple game
        where the player controls a ball and can spawn AI to chase them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from game development, I have also worked on several IT hardware
        projects, including repairing Xbox 360s with the red ring of death,
        fixing PS2 disc reading issues, and building PCs with both modern and
        early 2000 hardware. I have also worked with expensive and rare
        hardware such as AAA machines, and I have experience modding PS3 and
        Xbox360 consoles.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to game development and IT hardware repairs, I have also
        worked on small software projects such as PC stress testing, Unity
        tests, webpage proxies, Linux bash files, game mods, and Discord bots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from my technical skills, I am also a dedicated individual who
        is eager to learn and grow in my fields of interest. I am currently
        planning to recreate GTA 3 within Unity, starting with remastering old
        assets, recreating the map and player controllers, and attempting
        mission creation. I also have experience in server development work,
        having created multiple servers for BuffaloServers and DuckRP, among
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions or would like to learn more about my
        experience and skills, please don't hesitate to contact me via phone,
        email, or social media. I'm always eager to connect with others who
        share my passion for technology and game development.
